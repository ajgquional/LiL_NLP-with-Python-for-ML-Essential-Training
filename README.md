## Course details

With the increased amount of data publicly available and the increased focus on unstructured text data, understanding how to clean, process, and analyze that text data is tremendously valuable. If you have some experience with Python and an interest in natural language processing (NLP), this course can provide you with the knowledge you need to tackle complex problems using machine learning. Instructor Derek Jedamski provides a quick summary of basic natural language processing (NLP) concepts, covers advanced data cleaning and vectorization techniques, and then takes a deep dive into building machine learning classifiers. During this last step, Derek shows how to build two different types of machine learning models, as well as how to evaluate and test variations of those models.

## Learning objectives

* Identify the purpose of vectorizing.
* Recognize the outcomes of lemmatizing.
* Summarize the characteristics of TF-IDF.

### Notes about the exercise files:

* In some of the notebooks, minor codes have been changed from the original exercise files. This is due to the mismatch in the scikit-learn versions actually used and the one used in the original exercise files (the course was released on Mar. 23, 2018, so the scikit-learn used back then is outdated by today).
* The SMS dataset is the same throughout the course, but there is a separate copy per chapter folder to facilitate ease in usage of the dataset.
